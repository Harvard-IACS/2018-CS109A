    "In this lab, you will work with some noisy data.  You will use  simple linear and ridge regressions to fit linear, high-order polynomial features to the dataset.  You will attempt to figure out what degree polynomial fits the dataset the best and ultimately use cross validation to determine the best polynomial order.  Finally, you will automate the cross validation process using `sklearn` in order to determine the best regularization paramter for the ridge regression analysis on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should:\n",
    "* Really understand regularized regression principles.\n",
    "* Have a good grasp of working with ridge regression through the `sklearn` API\n",
    "* Understand the effects of the regularization (a.k.a penalization or tuning) parameter on fits from ridge regression\n",
    "* Understand the ideas behind cross-validation\n",

Noise was added to the function to generate synthetic, noisy observations via $y = f\\left(x\\right) + \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ was drawn from a random distribution.  The idea here is that in real life the data you are working with often comes with noise.  Even if you could make observations at every single value of $x$, the true function may still be obscured.  Of course, the samples you actually take are usually a subset of all the possible observations.

    "## Part 5: Cross-validation --- Finding the best penalization parameter\n",
    "Let's use cross-validation to determine the critical value of $\\lambda$, which we'll refer to as $\\lambda^*$. To do this we use the concept of a *meta-estimator* from `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection is supported by two distinct meta-estimators:\n",
    "1. `GridSearchCV`\n",
    "2. `RandomizedSearchCV`\n",
    "The input to these meta-estimators is an estimator, which has some hyperparameters (e.g. $\\lambda$) that need to be optimized, and a set of hyperparameter settings to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a meta-estimator allows us to wrap, for example, cross-validation, or methods that build and combine simpler models or schemes. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    est = Ridge()\n",
    "    parameters = {\"alpha\": [1e-8, 1e-6, 1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1.0]}\n",
    "    gridclassifier = GridSearchCV(est, param_grid=parameters, cv=4, scoring=\"neg_mean_squared_error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `GridSearchCV` replaces the manual iteration over the folds using `KFolds` and the averaging we just did, doing it all for us. It takes a hyperparameter grid in the shape of a dictionary as input, and sets $\\lambda$ to the values you want to try, one by one. It then trains the model using cross-validation, and gets the error for each value of the hyperparameter $\\lambda$. Finally it compares the errors for the different $\\lambda$'s, and picks the best choice model."
