    "Unfortunately, looping over an array slows things down. In general you should not access `numpy` array elements by iteration.  This is because of type conversion.  `Numpy` stores integers and floating points in `C`-language format.  When you operate on array elements through iteration, `Python` needs to convert that element to a `Python` `int` or `float`, which is a more complex beast (a `struct` in `C` jargon).  This has a cost.\n",

Some people recommend never using gridlines, while others insist on them being present.  The correct approach is probably somewhere in between.  Use gridlines when necessary, but dispense with them when they take away more than they provide.  Ask yourself if they help bring out some important conclusion from the plot.  If not, then best just keep them away.\n",
